# Predicting Customer Churn

## Description

This project was undertaken to practice data manipulation, exploration, visualization, and machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on predicting customer churn (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The primary goals were to enhance proficiency in working with data, addressing null values, and transforming data types within a dataset.

## Key Learnings

### Handling Null Values:
The project involved addressing null values in the dataset, employing techniques such as imputation or removal, contributing to a better understanding of data preprocessing.

### Data Type Transformation:
A crucial aspect of the project was transforming data types, particularly converting categorical variables to numeric ones for machine learning model compatibility.

## Libraries Used

### pandas: 
Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.

### seaborn: 
Utilized for data visualization.

### sklearn: 
Employed for implementing machine learning models.


## Project Structure

### Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to understand the dataset's characteristics, and null values were handled appropriately.


### Data Visualization:

Seaborn was employed to create visualizations, aiding in insights generation and communication.


### Machine Learning Model:

A logistic regression model was chosen to predict customer churn due to its suitability for binary classification tasks.
